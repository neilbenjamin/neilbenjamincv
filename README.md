## üåü Features

* **Personal Background:** Details about professional journey, hobbies, and skills beyond technical development.
* **Educational Overview:** Highlights the "Hyperion Dev - Full Stack Web Developer" course, outlining learned technologies and skills.
* **Core Subjects/Skills:** Lists key areas of proficiency, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Git, GitHub, and API's.
* **Contact Section:** Includes a "CONTACT" button/section for potential inquiries.
* **Responsive Design:** Leverages `bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap` for a responsive and modern user interface, ensuring accessibility across various devices.
* **Component-Based UI:** Built with React, demonstrating a modular and maintainable approach to UI development.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

**For this project to work, you must have Node.js installed on your system.**

If you don't have Node.js installed, please visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it. You can verify your installation by opening your terminal or command prompt and typing `node -v` and `npm -v`.

**Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:**

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    Obtain the project files and navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal. This directory should contain the `package.json` file.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the necessary project dependencies, including React, React DOM, React Scripts, and Bootstrap packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (Alternatively, if you use Yarn: `yarn install`)

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (Or `yarn start`)

    This command will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* **`npm start`**
    Runs the app in the development mode.
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

* **`npm test`**
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
    See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

* **`npm run build`**
    Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

    See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

* **`npm run eject`**
    **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

    If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

    You don‚Äôt have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature.
